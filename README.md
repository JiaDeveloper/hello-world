# hello-world
First ever github project "Hello World"

Hi githubbers!

I am Jia with Music Girl Media. I am using this project for the NEO smart contract workshop tomorrow. 

I am a music promoter organizing music shows and producing live streaming of performances. In my previous life I was a software developer. Music and technology are my love. Who can ask for more!

If you want to show off your code development telent or rock your singing and band performing, let me know and I will make you a STAR!
